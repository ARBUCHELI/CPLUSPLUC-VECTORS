* Introduction to Vectors
-------------------------
To do just about anything of interest in a program, we need a group of data to work with.

For example, our program might need:

	. A list of Twitterâ€™s trending tags

	. A set of payment options for a car

	. A catalog of eBooks read over the last year

The need for storing a collection of data is endless.

We are familiar with data types like int and double, but how do we store a group of ints or a group of doubles?

In this lesson, we will start with one of the simplest, and arguably the most useful, ways of storing data in C++: a vector.

A vector is a sequence of elements that you can access by index.

* Creating a Vector
-------------------
The std::vector lives in the <vector> header. So first, we need to add this line of code at the top of the program:

#include <vector>

For review, #include is a preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to include whatever library that follows. In our case that is the standard vector library.

And the syntax to create a vector looks like:

std::vector<type> name;

So to define a vector of ints called calories_today:

std::vector<int> calories_today;

Inside the angle brackets is the data type of the vector. After the angle brackets is the name of the vector.

Note: The type of the vector (i.e., what data type is stored inside) cannot be changed after the declaration.

tokyo.cpp
---------
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
   
  std::vector<double> subway_adult;
  
  // Declare another vector here:
  std::vector<double> subway_child;
    
  
}
